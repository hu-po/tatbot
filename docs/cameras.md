# Cameras

The `tatbot` system uses a combination of Amcrest IP cameras for wide-angle scene coverage and Intel Realsense depth cameras mounted on the robot arms for precise 3D sensing.

- `src/conf/cams/default.yaml`: The main configuration file for all cameras.
- `src/tatbot/data/cams.py`: The Pydantic data model for camera configurations.
- `src/tatbot/cam/`: The source module for all camera-related code, including calibration and capture.

## Calibration
Camera calibration is a critical step. While intrinsic parameters (focal length, sensor size) are relatively static, extrinsic parameters (the 3D pose of each camera in the world) must be calculated for the specific setup.

The `src/conf/cams/default.yaml` file contains **placeholder** extrinsics. To get real values, you must run the calibration script:
```bash
uv run python -m tatbot.cam.extrinsics
```
This script uses AprilTags to find the precise location of each camera relative to the world origin.

## IP PoE (ip)
Amcrest 5MP Turret POE Camera, UltraHD Outdoor IP Camera POE with Mic/Audio, 5-Megapixel Security Surveillance Cameras, 98ft NightVision, 132Â° FOV, MicroSD (256GB), (IP5M-T1179EW-AI-V3)

the cameras are currently set at:

- resolution: 1920x1080
- fps: 5
- bitrate CBR max 2048
- frameinterval: 10
- no substream, all watermarks off 

## Realsense (rs)
tatbot uses two [D405 Intel Realsense cameras](https://www.intelrealsense.com/depth-camera-d405/).

- [`pyrealsense2`](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense)
- both realsense cameras are connected to `hog` via usb3 port
- Follow the [calibration guide](https://dev.intelrealsense.com/docs/self-calibration-for-depth-cameras).
- Use the `rs-enumerate-devices` command to verify that both realsenses are connected. If this doesn't work, unplug and replug the realsense cameras.
- Should be calibrated out of the box, but can be recalibrated

- TODO: these will somewhat randomly fail, need to create robust exception handling
