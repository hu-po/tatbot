# TODO

Roughly sorted by priority

- random start spawn for design and inkcap for domain randomization in episode recording
- right hand orbiting movement for optimal skin reconstruction
- train splats on lerobot style data
- VR teleop using pyroki ik
- etymology section in paper
- camera pose as joint in urdf frame for extrinsic calibration
- inkdip as policy
- design wrapping using jax
- policy switching and composition into longer behaviors
- swiftsketch pattern
- apriltag on righthand wrist frame for extrinsic camera calibration
- host policy on replicate
- mcp to expose all robot nodes as tool for agent, mcp replace ros as middleware
- use ik solver for extrinsic camera calibration using apriltags
- tatbot website
- rust apriltag rtsp synced image and video mcp server
- rcam runs on raspberry pis, provides synced camera images and apriltag poses. meerkat runs lerobot controlling arms and realsenses. ojo runs policy server, skin reconstruction.
