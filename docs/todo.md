Roughly sorted by priority

- svg to path object
- calibrate camera extrinsics using scan dataset
- floating joint for apriltags in urdf
- floating joint for cameras in urdf
- vizer teleop in lerobot branch
- buttons: loop path, loop time, pause
- bimanual using ik collision
- camera poses in lerobot dataset 
- recalculate batch paths on design frame update
- pointcloud in scan lerobot dataset
- two color pattern (black w/ white higlights) seperated by arms
- three color pattern (black with 3d effect using blue andred) with one needle switch
- initialize gsplat with pointcloud
- bimanual arm with bendy stereo realsense cameras, central light, big Ethernet, and laptop on battery is hardware v3
- pattern wrapping over skin mesh using jax
- workspace tag to get realsense extrinsic, realsense extrinsic and intrinsics to get palette and skin tag, Realsense extrinsic to find big tag pose, big tag pose to get IP cameras extrinsic. Big tag is visible from all cameras
- rpi2 screen is on tatbot tower, 2 screens, put sound bar screen on top and non sound screen underneath connected to trossen.
- apriltags on back of robot in view of cameras
- isaacsim (https://www.youtube.com/live/z7KdHGkUTNE)
- compare fake skin and real skin calibration pattern
- squeeze bottle reveal ASMR
- random start spawn for design and inkcap for domain randomization in episode recording
- train splats on lerobot style data
- crop wrist pointcloud using cone from left hand, combine with cropped head pointcloud for skin mesh
- swiftsketch pattern
- etymology section in paper
- tatbot website
- host policy on replicate
- camera pose as joint in urdf frame for extrinsic calibration
- policy switching and composition into longer behaviors
- apriltag on righthand wrist frame for extrinsic camera calibration
- use ik solver for extrinsic camera calibration using apriltags
- rust apriltag rtsp synced image and video mcp server
- rcam runs on raspberry pis, provides synced camera images and apriltag poses. meerkat runs lerobot controlling arms and realsenses. ojo runs policy server, skin reconstruction.
- VR teleop using pyroki ik
- inkdip as policy
- wrist camera orbiting movement for optimal skin reconstruction
