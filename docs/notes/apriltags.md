we use apriltags to track various external objects in the workspace:
- camera 4 (tag #4)
- camera 5 (tag #5)
- palette (tbd)
- robot ee (tbd)
- robot base (tbd)
- trash bin (tbd)
- tool rack (tbd)
- tattoo machine (tbd)

apriltags are in 16h5 format, side length of 40mm

apriltags on cameras are flush with the camera lens cover, meaning the 6D pose of the tag is the same as the camera pose, except for a 35mm offset upwards and 5mm offset forwards relative to the camera view plane pose
