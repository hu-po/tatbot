# 📝 Documentation Style Guide

Short, minimal rules for writing docs that are easy to scan by humans and predictable for coding agents.

## Core Principles

- **Minimal:** Short paragraphs (1–3 sentences). Prefer lists over prose.
- **Predictable:** Stable section names, consistent headings, tested commands.
- **Scannable:** H2 with emojis; use code blocks, short admonitions, and sparse grids.
- **Agent-friendly:** Include commands, paths, and config near the top; use anchors and cross-refs.

## Page Template

Use this template as the default structure.

# Page Title

One short intro sentence.

```{admonition} Quick Reference
:class: tip
- Command: `uv run …`
- Path: `src/tatbot/...`
- Config: `src/conf/...`
```

## ⚡ Quick Start
- Step 1 …
- Step 2 …

## 🛠️ Configuration
```yaml
# Prefer literalinclude in real docs
key: value
```

## Usage
```bash
uv run python -m tatbot.viz.teleop --enable-robot
```

## Troubleshooting
- Symptom → Fix
- Error → Cause → Verify command

## Reference
- :doc:`Related Topic <nodes>`
- :ref:`Internal Anchor`
````

## Headings

- **H1:** Page title only (one per page). Must include emoji for visual appeal and topic identification.
- **H2:** Major sections, no emojis. Use clear, descriptive section names.
- **H3:** Subsections, no emoji. Avoid H4+; prefer lists or additional pages.

**Exception:** The root index page (docs/index.md) may use emojis in H2 headings for visual hierarchy and navigation aid.

## Visual Elements

- **Grids:** Use only for overviews/landing pages. Keep items concise.
- **Tabs:** Use for true alternatives (e.g., Method A vs B). Don’t tab trivial variations.
- **Admonitions:** Prefer built-ins: `{tip}`, `{note}`, `{warning}`, `{important}`. Keep content short.

Examples of fenced content inside examples must use four backticks:

````markdown
```{admonition} Prerequisites
:class: important
- Installed: `uv`, Python 3.11
```
````

## Agent Optimization

- Put a “Quick Reference” block near the top (commands, paths, config).
- Use consistent H2 anchors: "Quick Start", "Configuration", "Usage", "Troubleshooting", "Reference" (no emojis).
- Prefer structured lists over long paragraphs; avoid screenshots of text.
- Include real paths and commands; minimize interactive prompts and long outputs.

## Linking

- Prefer `:doc:` and `:ref:` for internal links; avoid raw file/line mentions.
- Use `literalinclude` to pull config/code from `src/` or `config/` to prevent drift.
- Use node substitutions defined in `conf.py` (e.g., `{{eek}}`) for consistent labels.

## Checklist

- H1 once; H2 without emojis (except root index); H3 only as needed.
- Intro + Quick Reference present and accurate.
- Commands tested; code blocks have language tags.
- Links resolve; cross-refs use `:doc:`/`:ref:`.
- Page stays focused (< ~800 words). Split if needed.

## Do / Don't

- Do: Lists, short admonitions, stable anchors, `literalinclude`, minimal grids.
- Don't: Emoji on H2/H3+ (except root index), decorative grids for simple lists, long terminal dumps, duplicate admonition styles.

## Implementation Notes

- Theme: Furo with copy buttons and `sphinx_design`.
- MyST: `colon_fence`, `substitution`, anchors up to H3 as configured in `conf.py`.
- Keep substitutions, CSS, and theme tweaks centralized (see `docs/conf.py`, `_static/tatbot.css`).
