# Distance-Based Stroke Padding Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary
Transform the tatbot stroke sampling system from fixed-point count to distance-based sampling with padding, enabling consistent spatial resolution across all strokes while maintaining GPU batch processing efficiency. This enhanced plan incorporates cross-agent insights and provides a comprehensive implementation roadmap.

## Current System Analysis

### Fixed Sampling Approach
- All strokes uniformly resampled to `scene.stroke_length` points (default: 16)
- Arc-length interpolation ensures even spacing within each stroke
- GPU batching requires uniform tensor shapes: `(batch, stroke_length, offset_num, dims)`
- Resampling occurs at multiple stages:
  - G-code parsing (`gcode.py:87` - `resample_path()`)
  - Surface mapping (`map.py:189` - geodesic resampling)
  - Inkdip generation (`inkdip.py:25-42` - fixed split ratios)

### Limitations
- **Quality Issues**:
  - Short strokes get oversampled (unnecessary point density)
  - Long strokes get undersampled (loss of detail)
  - Inconsistent spatial resolution across stroke lengths
- **Efficiency Issues**:
  - Fixed allocation wastes GPU memory on short strokes
  - No adaptation to design complexity
  - Suboptimal point distribution for varying stroke lengths

## Implementation Status

### Completed Features ✅
The following features have already been implemented in the codebase:

1. **Distance-based sampling in G-code parser** (`gcode.py`):
   - `resample_path_by_spacing()` function for uniform distance sampling
   - Auto-detection of optimal spacing based on design analysis
   - Fallback to legacy fixed-count mode when needed

2. **Automatic padding in batch processing** (`batch.py`):
   - `_pad_to_length()` function for array padding
   - Smart hover offset application to padded tail points
   - Maintains GPU batch compatibility

3. **Scene configuration support** (`scene.py`):
   - Added `stroke_point_spacing_m` field for distance configuration
   - Dynamic `stroke_length` adjustment based on maximum path length
   - Backward compatible with existing scenes

## Proposed Enhancements

### Phase 1: Configuration Improvements
1. **Add explicit configuration fields** (`src/conf/scenes/`):
   ```yaml
   # Distance-based sampling configuration
   stroke_sample_mode: "distance"  # "fixed" | "distance" | "auto"
   stroke_point_spacing_m: 0.002   # 2mm default spacing
   stroke_max_points: 128          # Maximum points for padding
   auto_sample_config:
     percentile: 90                # Use 90th percentile for auto-detection
     min_spacing_m: 0.001          # Minimum 1mm spacing
     max_spacing_m: 0.010          # Maximum 10mm spacing
   ```

2. **Meta configuration templates** (`src/conf/meta/`):
   - `fine_detail.yaml`: 1mm spacing for intricate designs
   - `standard.yaml`: 2mm spacing for normal designs
   - `fast_sketch.yaml`: 5mm spacing for quick previews

### Phase 2: Stroke Metadata Enhancement
1. **Extend Stroke class** (`src/tatbot/data/stroke.py`):
   ```python
   class Stroke(BaseCfg):
       # Existing fields...
       
       # Padding metadata
       actual_points: Optional[int] = None
       """Number of valid points before padding"""
       
       pad_mask: Optional[np.ndarray] = None
       """Boolean mask: True for valid points, False for padding"""
       
       arc_length_m: Optional[float] = None
       """Total arc length of the stroke in meters"""
       
       point_spacing_m: Optional[float] = None
       """Actual spacing used for this stroke"""
   ```

2. **Padding Strategies** (`src/tatbot/gen/padding.py`):
   ```python
   class PaddingStrategy(Enum):
       REPEAT_LAST = "repeat_last"      # Repeat last point (hover in place)
       LINEAR_INTERP = "linear_interp"  # Linear interpolation
       ZERO_PAD = "zero_pad"            # Pad with zeros
       HOVER_OFFSET = "hover_offset"    # Apply hover offset to padding
   
   def apply_padding(stroke: Stroke, target_len: int, strategy: PaddingStrategy) -> Stroke:
       """Apply selected padding strategy to stroke."""
   ```

### Phase 3: Intelligent Auto-Detection
1. **Design analyzer module** (`src/tatbot/gen/analyze.py`):
   ```python
   @dataclass
   class DesignStats:
       total_strokes: int
       total_length_m: float
       median_length_m: float
       complexity_score: float
       suggested_spacing_m: float
       suggested_max_points: int
   
   def analyze_design(gcode_files: List[Path]) -> DesignStats:
       """Analyze design complexity and suggest optimal parameters."""
   
   def compute_complexity_score(paths: List[np.ndarray]) -> float:
       """Score based on curvature, density, and detail level."""
   ```

### Phase 4: Surface Mapping Updates
1. **Update geodesic mapping** (`src/tatbot/gen/map.py`):
   - Preserve distance-based sampling through geodesic paths
   - Recalculate spacing based on 3D arc-length
   - Update padding after surface projection

### Phase 5: Execution Optimization
1. **Smart execution** (`src/tatbot/tools/robot/stroke.py`):
   - Skip padded points during robot execution
   - Use `actual_points` or `pad_mask` for efficient traversal
   - Optimize motion planning for variable-length strokes

2. **Visualization updates** (`src/tatbot/viz/stroke.py`):
   - Display actual vs padded points
   - Show point density heatmap
   - Indicate padding regions
