modify the tatbot source code to use padded strokes based around a configurable distance between points in a stroke. Currently all strokes are based on re-sampling paths from a gcode file based on a specific number of points. The consistent number of points is to ensure batched ik using the gpu works smoothly. We can also achieve this by using padding and instead making each stroke have a variable number of points. the number of points should be based on how much distance is covered by the path in the gcode file. So we can have a setting that will make sure that all strokes in a design end up with the same distance between points. We also need some clever way of maybe auto determining the padding/batch/distance size based on the design itself. Create a plan that investigates this new feature and put it in this folder at
